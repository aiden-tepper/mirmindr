## Introduction

### Value Proposition
*For Mirman students who need a way to manage their homework loads, the MirMindr Google Chrome extension is the perfect tool. Unlike Google Keep, MirMindr is made specifically for Mirman students, ergo enhancing the process.*

### Overview
MirMindr was designed in HTML, Sass, and JavaScript by Mirman students in the advanced Web Apps elective course. The code is compiled as a Google Extension. Its main features include: calendar integration, alerting notifications based on custom time, and it utilizes the Pomodoro method for motivations to complete the assignments.

Whether it be <i>English II Romeo and Juliet Test</i> or <i>US4 Musical Try-outs</i>, the name goes in the name input box. The next box, the subject box, is not a text input box. When you click on the box, a scroll will come down. At first, it will be blank.

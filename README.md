# The Manual

## Introduction

### Value Proposition
*For Mirman students who need a way to manage their homework loads, the MirMindr Google Chrome extension is the perfect tool. Unlike Google Keep, MirMindr is made specifically for Mirman students, ergo enhancing the process.*

### Overview
MirMindr was designed in HTML, Sass, and JavaScript by Mirman students in the advanced Web Apps elective course. The code is compiled as a Google Extension. Its main features include: calendar integration, alerting notifications based on custom time, and it utilizes the Pomodoro method for motivations to complete the assignments.

#### Log in
Once you are able to access the MirMindr Extension, MirMindr requires logging in.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8uouyPR.png"><br><br>Mirmindr fetches your email (only to use as an username you will never forget), but if the email is incorrect or not the email you want to log in with, change the email in the upper, email box. In the box that says password, enter in your password. Then press log in. If you get an error saying<br>`"Error: The specified password"`.<br><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img923/5153/9u7FzT.png"> Press `OK`, and you will be taken back to the log in screen (if the OK button is not pressed, the message will go away after 4 seconds). Then, re-enter the <i>correct</i> password. If you have done everything correctly, nice job! Welcome to MirMindr! You will be taken to the MirMindr homework management extension.

#### Forgot password
In the case that you forgot your password, on the Mirmindr homescreen, click the ``Forgot Password`` button and you will be taken to this screen: <br><br><img src=""><br><br> You will be sent an email explaining what to do next. It should say<br><br> ``Hello!``<br>``It looks like you've forgotten your password.``<br>``Use the following temporary password within the next 24 hours to log in and update your account: NEWPASSWORDWITHMANYLETTERSANDNUMBERS``<br>``Thanks!``<br>``--Powered by Firebase, https://www.firebase.com --``<br><Br>Your temporary password for the next 24 hours for your account is NEWPASSWORDWITHMANYLETTERSANDNUMBERS, where the text that has just been written stands for whatever follows ``your account: ``. After 24 hours, you can enter in a new password and use that password for your account for the rest of its existence unless you change the password or forget that password.

### Navigation

#### How to Make a Task
The MirMindr extension has so many features, its overwhelming! By now you should be at the following screen:
<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1JJ7ZHc.png"><br><br>The <img src="http://i.imgur.com/tYM3xgg.png">button enables you to log out of the extension. Once you do, to log back in, follow the steps in the section above. The <img src="http://i.imgur.com/4RWhax2.png">allows you to make a new task and if it is needed, a new subject. If you press the <img src="http://i.imgur.com/4RWhax2.png"> button, you will be taken to the following screen:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lHLh2OS.png"><br><br>The top input box is where you write the name of the task. Whether it be <i>English II Romeo and Juliet Test</i> or <i>US4 Musical Try-outs</i>, the name goes in the name input box. The next box, the subject box, is not a text input box. When you click on the box, a drop-down will drop down. At first, it will be blank. Your screen should look something like this:<br><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/uEAprqs.png"><br><br>You will then have to press the ``Edit Subjects`` button. Then you will be taken to the following window:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZPSqkwn.png"><br><br>Fill in the *name* and *period #* (you can only enter in numbers in the *period #* input), then click the ``Add`` button. If you haven't filled in everything, you will receive the ``Missing Something?`` error. Fill in everything, and then click ``Add`` again. Once you have subjects, you can fill in the due date. You can either enter in the date manually using the format MM/DD/YYYY (month/day/year), or you can click the <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Sdw09qc.png"> button to enable a calendar to drop-down. If you have clicked the <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Sdw09qc.png"> button, you will now have the <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8fDNp8K.png"><br><br>window. You can then select a date by scrolling to the date and clicking it. By now your screen should look something like this: <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7qsa5m2.png"><br><br> Once you have finished selecting the correct date, you can press ``Add``. You will be taken to this window: <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/J8OmEFr.png"><br><br>

#### Deleting, Editing, and "Done-ing" Tasks
Hovering your mouse over a task will make three buttons appear: <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fqZgPmy.png"><br><br> The button on the left, the <img src=""> button, is the button you press when you are done with the task. Note that this option only marks a task as "done"; it doesn't delete the task. The button in the middle, the <img src=""> button, is the button you press to edit the task. Finally, the button on the right, the <img src=""> button, is the button you press to delete the task. This cannot be undone.

#### Overdue Tasks
When something is overdue, its due date has passed. Tasks that have due dates that have passed, but are also marked as done, are not marked as overdue. When something is overdue, the text in the task turns red. 1 is also added to the counter on the bottom right of the extension symbol on the right of your url bar.

## Conclusion

Stay tuned for constant updates (i.e. task notifications, description options for tasks), there will also be a way for users to recommend new options and updates. And most importantly, have fun, manage your work, and enjoy *Mirmindr*!
